Title: Measuring Accretion Impact Radii with Optical and Gravitational Wave Observations of Compact Binaries

Dear Dr. Addison,

I have received the referees' report on your above submission to The Astrophysical Journal, and appended it below. As you will see, the referees thinks that your article is interesting and that it will merit publication once you have addressed the issues raised in the report.

My apologies for the delay in the review. As is often the case, the late first report arrived at about the same time as the second report we requested. I would like you to take both reports into consideration, though you may weigh your response as appropriate.

When you resubmit the manuscript, please include a detailed cover letter containing the listing of the changes you've made to the text and your responses to the report.

**Reviewers find it helpful if the changes in the text of the manuscript are easily distinguishable from the rest of the text. Therefore we ask you to print changes in bold face. The highlighting can be removed easily after the review.**

The Astrophysical Journal has adopted a new policy that manuscript files become inactive, and are considered to have been withdrawn, six months after the most recent referee's report goes to the authors, provided a revised version has not been received by that time.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

# Reviewer Report 1

###Reviewer's Comments:

This paper concerns an interesting proposal to measure accretion impact radii using optical and gravitational wave observations of AM CVn or HeCV systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on one known system (the original AM CVn system) to illustrate the (in some sense idealized) application of combining gravitational wave phase measurements with widely used methods in estimating accretion disc radii using hot spots. Specific attention is given to standard techniques used in modeling the accretion stream and in correcting for ellipsoidal variations and estimating source parameters from light curves. Less discussion is given to the gravitational wave calibration (section 3.4). The paper is clearly written in some parts, though can be shortened significantly in some sections (in particular, those sections which use well known modeling and analysis techniques such as Section 3) and some sections remain confusing. More discussion should be given to the astrophysical uncertainties in
the evolution of mass-transferring binaries, which of course impact the GW phase and lightcurve hot spot evolution. I recommend the article for publication modulo significant revisions. I list below suggestions that will hopefully improve the clarity of the article.

1) A noticeable omission of several related published articles in the field--it would be useful for the non-expert reader if these are referred to and briefly discussed. I have listed a non exhaustive list but encourage the authors to ensure that their references are uptodate: Shah et al., 2013, 14a, 2014b, Benacquista 2011, Fuller and Lai 2013a, b, Stroeer and Nelemans 2009, Nissanke et al. 2012.

2) Figures: most of the later figures in the paper are hard to read (e.g., fig. 12) and often lack units.

3) Abstract: Given the results presented in the paper, the following statement is misleading: "the results suggest that for a large number of systems at a variety of inclinations, accretion disk radii can be measure to a precision of better than 5%". Please can the authors explain why they are able to conclude this from its application to one system and to the results presented in Section 4.3, and also what is the improvement gained by having gravitational wave phase measurements. The fact that the proposed method is applied to one (and in some sense an extremely favourable) system (AM CVn) should be mentioned.

4) Introduction: It would be useful for the non-expert reader to explain why CVs are so dim in para. 4. Also, are spaced-based GW detectors really sensitive to as many as 20 000 CVs? My understanding was that there are far fewer AM CVn systems observed than expected from pop. synthesis (e.g., Roelofs et al. 2007, Levitan et al. 2013, Nissanke et al. 2012). It would be useful if the authors could give the references for these quoted numbers. Also, do all HeCV systems have accretion discs of unknown radii (last sentence of para.4) ? Some eclipsing AM CVn systems have been detected.

5) Introduction: Para 5 -- I am once again confused by the numbers given for tens of thousands of individually detectable HeCV systems using space-based gravitational wave detectors. Please check these numbers. Also, it would be useful if the paper can specify upfront what information is particularly useful from `multi-messenger mode of observations' in their specific case.

6) Section 2: how many lightcurve meaurements from eclipsing systems have so far enabled accretion disk measures? The paper references Sulkanen et al. (1981b) but are there any more recent references?

7) Section 2.2.: a few parameters remain undefined for Eqn. 1 ...Also, it might be useful for the non-expert reader if the authors explain why a gravitational wave space-based observer will characterize both polatization amplitudes (i.e., from its own modulation in the sky).

8) Figure 5 is confusing though plays a key role in the paper. I do not see $alpha_{star}$ noted on the diagram itself.

9) Sections 3 and 4 could be shortened and was confusing in its presentation at times. Section 3.4 is surprisingly brief giving barely any information on how the simulated gravitational wave strains were produced (Fig. 11 is confusing -- no units on the y-axis).

10) The discussion: section 5 is extremely brief, especially in relation to the statements made in the abstract. The gain of the authors proposed method to those used without gravitational wave calibrated measurements should be mentioned.

11) Whilst reading the paper several times, I noticed several typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper (e.g., p.5 it's closest distance -> its closest distance). Hopefully these will also be picked up during the editorial process.

# Reviewer Report 2

###Reviewer's Comments:

This paper demonstrates how multi-messenger (GW+EM) observations of mass-transferring ultra-compact binary systems in the Milky Way can be used to infer properties of the primary star's accretion disk. The paper is well written and clearly, methodically, steps through the logic and procedure used by the authors to arrive at the conclusion: That multi-messenger observations provide independent constraints on the disk radius regardless of whether or not the binary is eclipsing.

I recommend this paper for publication but there are two details I would like the authors to address.

First: The authors mention that good constraints on the mass of each star in the binary will come from the gravitational wave observations, and the masses are inputs into the model for the light curve. The individual masses are not directly inferred from most white-dwarf binaries (see e.g. A. Stroeer et al. 2005 ApJ 633 L33). Instead the chirp mass (a combination of the component masses) is well determined but the total mass is degenerate with the distance and all that can be recovered is the gravitational wave amplitude. The degeneracy can be broken for detached binaries by measuring orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission. However, for mass-transferring systems an independent distance measure will be needed to break the degeneracy and determine the total mass and thereby the individual masses. The authors need to acknowledge the challenge of determining component masses and consider the covariance between the component masses and the disk radius measurement. In
the absence of good distance measurements, are strong priors on the individual masses needed for this method to work?

Second: The authors correctly state that many LISA sources will also be detectable electromagnetically, but do not mention that the majority of those may be detached white dwarf binaries. During discussion of the potentially large population of multi-messenger signals it would be appropriate to mention (roughly) what fraction of those signals will exhibit the light-curves modeled in this work.
